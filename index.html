            Jumble Hunt is a shooting gallery style word jumble game. The letters of a word 
            will be rearranged in a random order and displayed on the screen. The player must 
            “shoot” the letters in the correct order to unscramble the word. <br><br>
            There are 5 levels to Jumble Hunt. Level 1 begins with four letter words, as you 
            progress through the levels, a letter will be added to the length of the word. 
            By Level 5, the words will be eight letters long. <br><br> To advance to the next level, 
            you must correctly unscramble three words per level. You get three attempts to 
            correctly unscramble a presented word. If you have three unsuccessful attempts 
            during the game, you lose and the game is over. If you successfully unscramble 
            three words per level with less than three failed attempts, you win the game and 
            the game is over. You do have access to unlimited cheats, however for each cheat 
            your score will be reset to 0.
