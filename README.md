Jumble Hunt is a shooting gallery style word jumble game. The letters of a word will be rearranged in a random order and displayed on the screen. The player must “shoot” the letters in the correct order to unscramble the word.

## Why Jumble Hunt?
I love word games. They are a fun way to improve one’s vocabulary and spelling abilities. Jumble Hunt combines the educational benefits of a word jumble game with an intuitive, fun, user friendly graphical interface. Why make an educational shooting game? Here's why:

* Americans are bad spellers. According to the U.S. Department of Education, in 2020, 54% of U.S. adults 16-74 years old (over 130 million people), lack proficiency in literacy, and read below a sixth-grade level.

* Americans love guns. In 2020, 42 percent of U.S. households reported owning one or more firearms. While only 4% of the world’s population, Americans own approximately 40% of civilian-owned guns globally.

* Americans love apps. Also in 2020, Americans downloaded a total of roughly 12.3 billion mobile apps! 

Jumble Hunt attempts to pair America’s love of guns and mobile gaming to improve literacy! 

## Rules
1 player

The game consists of 5 levels. Level 1 begins with four letter words. As the player progresses through the levels, one letter is added to the length of the word, ending with eight letter words in Level 5. To advance to the next level, the player must correctly unscramble three words per level. During the game, the player gets three attempts to correctly unscramble a presented word. If the player has three unsuccessful attempts during the game, the player loses and the game is over. If the player successfully unscrambles three words per level with less than three failed attempts, the player wins the game and the game is over. The player has access to unlimited cheats and can easily beat the game that way (shame).

## Scoring
The player receives one point for every successfully unscrambled word. The player loses a point for every unsuccessful attempt. Everytime the player uses a cheat, their score will be set to zero.

## Next Steps

* Connect to dictionary API
* Connect to database to set and monitor high score
* Check for all possible words that can be assembled from the scrambled letters using all letters. If player unscrambles the letters to form a legitimate word, but it is not the intended word, it should still be counted as correct and player should advance. Example: PALM & LAMP.
